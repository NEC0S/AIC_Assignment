    "When comparing distances between different paths in a 2D grid of constrained straight interlocking paths, the most appropriate metric would likely be the **Manhattan distance**, also known as the L1 distance or taxicab distance. This distance metric measures the distance between two points along the axes at right angle.\n",

    "Euclidean Distance(L2):\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. It measures the length of the shortest path between two points. In a 2D grid, it calculates the diagonal distance between points, which might not be suitable for constrained paths where movement is limited to horizontal and vertical steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minkowski Distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Minkowski distance is a generalization of both Euclidean and Manhattan distances. It allows for adjusting a parameter pp, where p=1p=1 gives Manhattan distance, p=2p=2 gives Euclidean distance, and other values give different weighting to dimensions. However, in a grid environment, adjusting pp may not provide significant advantages over using Manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chebyshev Distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chebyshev distance, also known as chessboard distance, measures the maximum distance along any coordinate axis. It allows for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal movements. While it's more flexible than Manhattan distance in terms of possible movements, it may not accurately represent path lengths in constrained grid environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine Distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine distance measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It is often used in high-dimensional spaces to measure the similarity between vectors. In a 2D grid context, it might not be directly applicable for comparing paths unless the paths are represented as vectors of features.\n"

It is computed as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of the two vectors.Calculate the magnitude (or Euclidean norm) of each vector. The magnitude represents the length of the vector in the high-dimensional space, and Divide the dot product of the vectors by the product of their magnitudes to obtain the cosine of the angle between them. This normalized value ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates that the vectors are in the same direction (i.e., highly similar), 0 indicates orthogonality (i.e., no similarity), and -1 indicates they are in opposite directions (i.e., highly dissimilar)."
